My Project two involved completing a Git demo and creating a starter repo on Git Hub that featured an image from the demo.

Project Three entailed creating two applications that requested images of a certain tag from outside sources, Flickr and 500px.

Project Four was similar to project three but was an application that requested photos from Unsplash and requested videos from Youtube.
